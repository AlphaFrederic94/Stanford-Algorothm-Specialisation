# Stanford-Algorithms-Specialization
This specialization is an introduction to data structures and algorithms. It emphasizes the big picture and conceptual understanding over low-level implementation and mathematical details.

Taught by [Tim Roughgarden](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~768), and provided and available on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org).

## Introduction
This repository contains solutions to the assignments of Stanford Algorithms Specialization. Please attempt the assignments on your own first. You can always consult the discussion forum for hints or explanations. I found it super helpful on my learning journey. Use this as a reference only. 

And in no way is this course even close to a real-world implementation when it comes to programming. Additional learning resources are highly suggested.

I would still encourage those who successfully tackled the problems to look at other people's solutions in that everyone's brain works differently. Sometimes different approaches may spark some ideas or probably inspire you in the long run. And then you can incorporate those ideas into your programming toolbox.

It wasn't eaasy for me to finish this course as a lvl-3 college student though it really took me time, patience, efforts qnd much self comtrol to finish this. 

I took approximately 4-5 months since begining of the year 2024. Yeah I got overdiewed from time to time @(*-*)@

There are days you'll feel like breaking your PC becaue of the time it'll take to execute others were a process execution might be too slow. Believe you'll switch frm programming languagues to the next to see which will be better faster and easier to use for a particular problem. A good advice: Have a powerful machine. I understood its importance through the specialization

If any other university or college student takes this course like me; MUCH COURAGE. 

I won't provide answers to the quiz beacause I think its necessary to understand any basic concept as hard as it can be but in the end its necessary.       

Happy codingðŸ˜ƒ
